    <!-- Origin Story -->
    <section>
      <h2>How Edunancial Was Born</h2>
      <p>
        Edunancial began with a simple observation: smart, hardworking people were
        leaving school without the tools to make confident money decisions. We kept
        hearing the same questions—How do I budget? What’s a credit score? Where do I start
        investing?—in classrooms, community centers, and living rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we started small: free, plain-language workshops for teens and young adults,
        offered in English and Spanish. The first handout became a short booklet. The
        booklet grew into a practical book. From there, Edunancial took shape as a
        bilingual learning hub focused on one goal: **turn financial literacy into a
        habit** anyone can start today.
      </p>
      <p><em>“La educación financiera abre puertas.”</em> We built Edunancial to hold those doors open.
