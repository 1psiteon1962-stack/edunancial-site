    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      Edunancial started with a simple, powerful moment. My son was <strong>11 years old</strong> when he walked into my office just as a payment hit my phone. He asked, “How did you do that?” I told him: <em>“I work with my head. Do you want to work with your head too?”</em> He said yes—he just didn’t know how yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today at 15, he can pick stocks with an 8–12% ROI, buys physical gold and silver, wants to learn options, and is planning a business. That growth proves what we believe: <strong>practical financial education helps people improve their own circumstances.</strong>
