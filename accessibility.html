  <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
  <p>
    Edunancial, Inc. is committed to making our website and online content
    accessible to as many people as possible, including individuals with
    disabilities. We aim to follow widely recognized accessibility
    standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
  </p>

  <h2>Measures We Take</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Using clear headings and structured HTML where possible;</li>
    <li>Providing text alternatives for key images and graphics;</li>
    <li>Using readable fonts and sufficient color contrast;</li>
    <li>Designing layouts with keyboard navigation in mind.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <p>
    Although we strive to make all pages accessible, some legacy content,
    third-party tools, embedded videos, or downloads may not yet fully meet
    all accessibility standards. We continually work to improve these areas.
