      <h1>United States — Founder Routing Hub</h1>

      <p>
        The United States is the core financial and legal backbone of global
        entrepreneurship. Most serious capital, IP protection, and payment rails
        terminate here.
      </p>

      <h2>What Edunancial Does</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell courses. We map founders into systems where they can survive,
        scale, and attract capital.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>We detect regulatory and banking friction</li>
        <li>We detect tax and IP traps</li>
        <li>We detect court and enforcement risk</li>
        <li>We route founders into jurisdictions that work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why the US Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Delaware, Wyoming, and US banking rails allow founders from Africa, Europe,
        Asia, and Latin America to plug into global capital markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Edunancial exists to make that navigation systematic instead of accidental.
