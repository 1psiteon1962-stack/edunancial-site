    <GlobalLayout title="Edunancial — Emerging Asia">
      <p>
        Edunancial’s Emerging Asia focus addresses environments where economic
        systems are still forming, capital access is uneven, and institutional
        maturity varies significantly by location.
      </p>

      <p>
        Participants in these markets often navigate rapid growth, informal
        structures, evolving regulation, and early-stage capital deployment
        without established reference models.
      </p>

      <h2>Primary Emphasis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Foundational capital literacy without abstraction</li>
        <li>System awareness before scale or expansion</li>
        <li>Distinguishing opportunity from structural risk</li>
        <li>Transferable frameworks adaptable to local realities</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Thinking Progression</h2>
      <p>
        The focus is not acceleration, speculation, or hype. The focus is
        sequence — understanding systems first, then applying discipline,
        before attempting growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Access Model</h2>
      <p>
        Entry-level system understanding is open. Structured frameworks,
        scenario mapping, and applied capital logic are available through
        controlled access as users progress.
