      <h2>Capital Discipline</h2>

      <p>
        Capital Discipline is the skill of understanding how money, ownership,
        and economic systems actually work — across borders, industries, and
        stages of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        This platform is not about shortcuts or speculation. It is about learning
        how capital behaves, how risk is structured, and how individuals can
        participate responsibly in wealth-building systems over time.
      </p>

      <h3>The Three Paths (Red, White, and Blue)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Red — Real Assets</strong>: property, land, infrastructure,
          tangible resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>White — Financial Assets</strong>: paper instruments, markets,
          structured products, capital flows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blue — Businesses</strong>: ownership, operations, systems,
          and value creation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Participants may pursue one path, multiple paths, or all three. Capital
        Discipline improves outcomes regardless of direction.
