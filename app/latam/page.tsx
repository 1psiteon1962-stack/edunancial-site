      <h1>Latin America</h1>

      <p>
        Latin America operates within mixed capital systems shaped by inflation,
        currency volatility, entrepreneurship, and regional trade.
      </p>

      <h2>Capital Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        Capital Discipline in Latin America focuses on resilience, currency
        awareness, and structural understanding rather than short-term gains.
      </p>

      <h2>Three Capital Paths</h2>

      <h3 style={{ color: "#b91c1c" }}>Red — Property & Tangible Holdings</h3>
      <p>
        Real assets often serve as inflation hedges and long-term value anchors
        across many Latin American economies.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: "#1f2937" }}>White — Financial & Market Exposure</h3>
      <p>
        Market participation ranges from local exchanges to global platforms,
        requiring heightened awareness of regulatory and currency dynamics.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: "#1d4ed8" }}>Blue — Entrepreneurship & Family Enterprise</h3>
      <p>
        Business ownership plays a central role in wealth continuity, often tied
        closely to family structures and regional networks.
      </p>

      <h2>Access & Progression</h2>
      <p>
        Users begin with free analytical frameworks and may later choose structured
        access paths aligned with their objectives and jurisdictional realities.
