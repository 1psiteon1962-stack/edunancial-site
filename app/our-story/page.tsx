      <h1>Our Story</h1>

      <p>
        Edunancial did not start as a “business idea.” It started as a discipline program inside my home.
      </p>

      <h2>Discipline Before Dollars</h2>

      <p>
        When my son was 11, I didn’t start by teaching him hype, hacks, or shortcuts. I started with one rule:
        build discipline first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every month he bought at least one ounce of pure silver. Coin or bar—didn’t matter, as long as it was real,
        measurable, and consistent. The point was never “silver will make you rich.” The point was training:
        behavior, patience, and proof.
      </p>

      <p>
        As prices rose, we adapted. When silver got expensive, we discussed buying smaller units. Later, he made his
        own independent decision: he shifted from silver to gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he couldn’t afford a full ounce at a time. So he began buying gold in grams—stacking until 31 grams became
        one ounce. Same discipline. Same system. Just a smarter path for reality.
      </p>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Most programs sell motivation. Edunancial sells structure. We focus on systems people can execute, with proof,
        especially in economies where time-to-income matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the foundation of everything we build: practical modules, disciplined execution, and continent-aware
        strategy—without political messaging, and without promising outcomes.
      </p>
