      <h1>United States</h1>

      <p>
        The United States represents one of the most developed capital systems in
        the world, offering multiple structured paths for individuals to build,
        manage, and preserve wealth.
      </p>

      <h2>Capital Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        Capital Discipline is the foundational framework used across Edunancial.
        It focuses on how capital behaves, how systems reward discipline over time,
        and how individuals can better understand those systems without being
        dependent on speculation, hype, or shortcuts.
      </p>

      <h2>Three Capital Paths</h2>

      <h3 style={{ color: "#b91c1c" }}>Red — Real Assets</h3>
      <p>
        Real assets include property, land, and tangible holdings. In the U.S.,
        these systems are heavily regulated, highly leveraged, and closely tied to
        credit, interest rates, and taxation.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: "#1f2937" }}>White — Paper & Financial Instruments</h3>
      <p>
        This path includes equities, options, bonds, and market-linked instruments.
        These systems reward understanding of valuation, risk, liquidity, and time.
      </p>

      <h3 style={{ color: "#1d4ed8" }}>Blue — Businesses & Ownership</h3>
      <p>
        Business ownership is the most flexible capital path in the U.S., allowing
        individuals to design income, control risk, and scale systems beyond wages.
      </p>

      <h2>Access & Progression</h2>
      <p>
        Visitors begin with free analytical frameworks and conceptual models.
        Advanced tools, structured breakdowns, and applied systems become available
        as users choose to go deeper.
