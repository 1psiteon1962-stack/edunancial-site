        <h2>Capital Discipline Framework</h2>

        <p>
          All modern wealth systems resolve into three capital paths. These are
          not promises or products — they are structural realities.
        </p>

        <h3>🔴 Red — Real Assets</h3>
        <p>
          Land, housing, infrastructure, and tangible collateral. Capital that
          exists independently of financial markets.
        </p>

        <h3>⚪ White — Paper & Financial Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Credit, equities, contracts, and regulated instruments. Capital that
          compounds through rules and leverage.
        </p>

        <h3>🔵 Blue — Businesses & Operations</h3>
        <p>
          Companies, execution systems, cash flow, and scale. Capital created
          through disciplined management.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem", fontStyle: "italic" }}>
          The mistake is not choosing the wrong path — it is failing to
          understand how the paths interact.
