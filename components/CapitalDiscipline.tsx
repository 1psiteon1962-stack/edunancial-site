      <h2>Capital Discipline</h2>

      <p>
        Every path to wealth—real assets, paper assets, or businesses—fails
        without discipline. Capital Discipline is not about speed, hype, or
        promises. It is about structure, control, patience, and decision-making
        under uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before choosing where to allocate capital, individuals must understand
        how capital behaves, how risk compounds, and how mistakes scale faster
        than success. Capital Discipline is the foundation that allows people to
        pursue one path, multiple paths, or change paths without collapsing.
      </p>

      <p>
        This platform teaches Capital Discipline first—because disciplined
        capital survives long enough to grow.
