      <h2>Capital Paths: Red, White, and Blue</h2>

      <p>
        Economic systems offer multiple paths toward stability, growth, and long-term wealth.
        Historically, these paths fall into three broad categories.
      </p>

      <h3>🔴 Red — Real Assets</h3>
      <p>
        Real assets include property, land, and physical infrastructure.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Location-dependent</li>
        <li>Require capital, leverage, and regulatory awareness</li>
        <li>Build wealth through cash flow, control, and time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Real assets reward patience and discipline, but punish over-leverage and poor structure.
      </p>

      <h3>⚪ White — Paper Assets</h3>
      <p>
        Paper assets include stocks, bonds, funds, and financial instruments.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Liquid and market-driven</li>
        <li>Require risk management and emotional control</li>
        <li>Compound effectively when approached with discipline</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Paper assets reward literacy and restraint, but punish speculation and impulse.
      </p>

      <h3>🔵 Blue — Businesses</h3>
      <p>
        Businesses include operating companies, services, and scalable enterprises.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Highest upside and highest failure rate</li>
        <li>Depend on systems, governance, and execution</li>
        <li>Create value through scale rather than ownership alone</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Businesses reward structure and leadership, but punish chaos and ego.
      </p>

      <h3>One Discipline. Multiple Paths.</h3>
      <p>
        Edunancial does not tell users which path to pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we focus on capital discipline — the behaviors, structures, and decision frameworks
        that determine whether any path succeeds or fails.
      </p>
      <p>
        The path is a choice. The discipline is mandatory.
