        Edunancial was created out of frustration with how financial knowledge
        is usually taught — fragmented, overly theoretical, or disconnected from
        real responsibility.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
        This platform is built on discipline, structure, and preparation.
        Financial literacy is not about shortcuts. It is about understanding
        systems, incentives, risk, and time.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
        We focus on founders who want to build responsibly, families who want to
        protect and grow wealth across generations, and youth who deserve access
        to real financial understanding before mistakes become expensive.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
        Edunancial does not sell promises. It builds readiness.
