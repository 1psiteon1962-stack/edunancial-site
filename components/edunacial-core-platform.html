    <h2>Understanding Systems. Making Informed Choices.</h2>
    <p>
      Edunancial exists to help individuals understand how financial, legal,
      and institutional systems actually function — so they can make informed
      decisions about their own path forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not promise outcomes. We do not prescribe destinations.
      We provide clarity, structure, and context so each person can decide
      where their journey leads.
