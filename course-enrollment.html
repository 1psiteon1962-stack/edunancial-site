  <h1>Course Enrollment Terms</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> ____________________</p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    These Course Enrollment Terms apply to all live or recorded classes,
    workshops, bootcamps, and online programs offered by Edunancial, Inc.
    (“Courses”).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Educational Purpose Only</h2>
  <p>
    Courses are for educational purposes only. They do not provide legal,
    tax, or investment advice. Results are not guaranteed.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Enrollment and Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enrollment is personal to you and may not be shared or transferred.</li>
    <li>Access may be time-limited (for example, 90 days or 12 months); any such limits will be stated in the Course description.</li>
    <li>We may provide replays or recordings at our discretion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Student Conduct</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to participate respectfully, avoid harassment or disruption,
    and comply with all Course rules. We may remove any participant who
    behaves inappropriately, without refund, where permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All Course materials, including slides, recordings, worksheets, and
    templates, are owned by Edunancial or its licensors. You receive a
    limited license for personal or internal business use and may not
    share, resell, or republish any Course materials.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Recordings and Likeness</h2>
  <p>
    Live Courses may be recorded. By attending, you consent to being
    recorded and allow Edunancial to use such recordings for educational or
    marketing purposes, subject to applicable privacy and publicity laws.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Refunds and Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Unless a specific Course page states otherwise, Course fees are
    non-refundable once access has been granted or the event has occurred.
    Transfers to a later cohort may be allowed at our discretion.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Relationship to Other Policies</h2>
  <p>
    These Course Enrollment Terms supplement the Terms of Use, Privacy
    Policy, Membership Terms, and Digital Products Terms. If there is a
    conflict, the more protective provision for Edunancial’s intellectual
    property and business rights will govern.
