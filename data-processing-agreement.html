  <h1>Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> ____________________</p>

  <h2>1. Parties</h2>
  <p>
    This Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) forms part of the agreement
    between Edunancial, Inc. (“Edunancial,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and any
    customer or user (“Customer,” “you,” or “your”) who provides personal
    data to Edunancial in connection with the Services.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Roles of the Parties</h2>
  <p>
    For the purposes of data protection laws, Edunancial generally acts as
    a “data controller” for personal data collected through our Site and
    Services. In limited situations where we process personal data solely
    on your documented instructions (for example, where you upload contact
    lists to our systems), we act as a “data processor.”
  </p>

  <h2>3. Processing Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    When Edunancial acts as a data processor, we will:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Process personal data only on your documented instructions;</li>
    <li>Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data;</li>
    <li>Ensure confidentiality obligations for personnel with access to personal data;</li>
    <li>Assist you, where reasonable, in responding to data subject requests;</li>
    <li>Notify you without undue delay of any personal data breach we become aware of that affects your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sub-Processors</h2>
  <p>
    You authorize Edunancial to engage third-party service providers
    (“Sub-Processors”) to support the delivery of the Services. We will
    ensure that Sub-Processors are bound by written obligations that
    provide at least the same level of protection for personal data as this
    DPA.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Upon termination of the Services or upon your written request, we will
    delete or return personal data we process on your behalf, unless
    retention is required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Audits</h2>
  <p>
    On reasonable notice, and no more than once per year, you may request
    information reasonably necessary to demonstrate Edunancial’s
    compliance with this DPA. We may satisfy this obligation by providing
    certifications, third-party audit reports, or written summaries of our
    security practices.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    This DPA is governed by the same law and jurisdiction specified in our
    main Terms of Use.
  </p>
