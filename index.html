    <h1 class="h1">Our Story</h1>
    <p>When my <strong>11-year-old son</strong> walked in as I ended a call with a client, my phone lit up with an online deposit. His eyes widened: “How did you make money like that?” I told him: “I used my head.” He said, “I want to do that, but I don’t know how.”</p>
    <p>That moment sparked <strong>Edunancial</strong> — a simple promise: anyone can learn financial literacy and use knowledge to change their circumstances.</p>
    <p>At <strong>15</strong>, my son bought physical silver and gold, began analyzing companies, and learned to select stocks — earning <strong>8–12% ROI</strong> while building confidence and discipline. If he can do it, <em>you</em> can too.</p>
    <p>We teach in <strong>red, white, and blue</strong> tracks — from fast intro lessons to deeper, action-ready trainings. Start small, build strong habits, and grow.</p>
