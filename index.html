  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <div class="card">
    <p>One afternoon when my son was <strong>11</strong>, he walked in just as I finished a call with a business client. My phone lit up—an online deposit had arrived. His eyes got wide: “How did you make money like that?”</p>
    <p>“By using my head,” I said. “Do you want to learn how?” “Yes,” he answered, “but I don’t know how.”</p>
    <p>That moment planted the seed. By <strong>15</strong>, he was buying physical silver and gold, analyzing companies, and practicing how to select and sell stocks—aiming for a steady <strong>8–12% ROI</strong>.</p>
    <p>That journey became <strong>Edunancial</strong>: practical financial literacy for anyone who wants to build a better future.</p>
