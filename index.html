      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>One afternoon when my son was 11, he walked in just as an online deposit arrived.
      His eyes went wide: “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” 
      Then I asked him, “Do you want to work with your head?” He said, “Yes… but I don’t know how.”
      <strong>That’s when Edunancial was born.</strong></p>
