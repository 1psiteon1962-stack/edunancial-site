  <h1>Our Story</h1>

  <article>
    <p class="lead">
      One afternoon when my son was 11, he walked in just as an online deposit arrived. His eyes went wide:
      “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.”
    </p>
    <p>Then I asked, “Do you want to work with your head?” He said, “Yes… but I don’t know how.” <strong>That’s when Edunancial was born.</strong></p>

    <p>At 11, he started buying <strong>silver coins</strong>. This taught him discipline. It ensured he was spending his money on an asset—rather than spending it, like many kids, on games and candy that wouldn’t put money back in his pocket.</p>

    <p>Around 12 years old, he began making lists of stocks he wanted to purchase. I had him analyze them—were they overvalued or undervalued? After he came back with his answers and reasons, we bought the stocks. His results produced an average ROI of <strong>7–12%</strong>.</p>

    <p>At 15, he decided to not only purchase silver, but also <strong>gold</strong>. Today we’re exploring other possibilities, including precious gems such as diamonds, rubies, or emeralds.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Red, White, and Blue</strong> methodology isn’t about telling you <em>what</em> to buy. It’s about helping you ask the right question first: <em>Why am I buying this? What is it going to do for me?</em> It puts you in control of your own financial future.</p>

    <p>Today, my son continues to use Red, White, and Blue to build his financial future—he is now planning a dog food business. As a father, I feel good knowing that he has a strong foundation for lifelong learning that will only improve over time.</p>

    <p class="muted">Make it, and let’s get started together.</p>
