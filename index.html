  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <div class="card">
    <p>When my son was 11, he walked in just as an online deposit arrived. He asked, “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” He wanted to learn—that’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born.</p>
    <p>By 15 he bought physical silver and gold, analyzed companies, and practiced how to select and sell stocks aiming for a steady 8–12% ROI. Anyone can learn practical financial literacy and improve their life.</p>
