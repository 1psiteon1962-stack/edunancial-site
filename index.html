  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>One afternoon when my son was 11, he came in my room just as an electronic deposit notification arrived. His eyes went wide. “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” Then I asked, “Do you want to work with your head?” He said, “Yes… but I don’t know how.” That’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born.</p>
  <p>At 11, he started buying silver coins—discipline and assets instead of candy and games. Around 12, he began analyzing stocks: overvalued or undervalued, and why. After he presented his reasons, we bought. His results averaged <strong>7–12%</strong>. At 15, he added gold—and today we consider gems like diamonds, rubies, or emeralds.</p>
  <p>The <strong>Red, White, and Blue</strong> method doesn’t tell you what to buy—it teaches you to ask <em>why</em> you’re buying and what it will do for you, putting you in control of your financial future.</p>
  <p>Today, my son still uses Red, White, and Blue—he’s planning a dog-food business. As a father, I feel good knowing he has a foundation for lifelong learning that will only improve over time.</p>
