    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>One afternoon when my son was 11, the mail arrived with a deposit notification. His eyes went wide: “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” Then I asked, “Do you want to work with your head?” He said, “Yes… but I don’t know how.” That’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born.</p>
    <p>At 11, he started buying silver coins. This taught him discipline. It ensured he was putting money into an <em>asset</em>—not spending it, like many kids, on games or candy that wouldn’t put money in his pocket.</p>
    <p>Around 12, he began making lists of stocks he wanted to purchase. I had him analyze each one: Was it overvalued or undervalued? Why? After he returned with his answers and reasons, we bought the stocks. His results produced an average ROI of <strong>7–12%</strong>.</p>
    <p>At 15, he decided to purchase not only silver, but also gold. Today we are exploring other possibilities, including precious gems such as diamonds, rubies, or emeralds.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Red, White, and Blue</strong> methodology isn’t about telling you <em>what</em> to buy. It’s about helping you ask the right question first: <em>Why am I buying this? What is it going to do for me?</em> It puts you in control of your own financial future.</p>
    <p>Today, my son continues to use the Red, White, and Blue to build his financial future—he is now planning a dog food business. As a father, I feel good knowing that he has a strong foundation for lifelong learning that will only improve over time.</p>
