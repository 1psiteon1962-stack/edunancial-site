      <p>One afternoon when my son was 11, he walked in just as an online deposit arrived. His eyes went wide: “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” Then I asked him, “Do you want to work with your head?” He said, “Yes… but I don’t know how.” <strong>That’s when Edunancial was born.</strong></p>
      <p>At 15, he analyzes, buys, and sells stocks with ranges of <strong>8–12% ROI</strong>; understands there are many areas in real estate to pick from, and is putting a business together.</p>
      <p>Simple lessons in <strong>Red</strong> (Real Estate), <strong>White</strong> (Paper Assets), and <strong>Blue</strong> (Business). These are the <strong>foundations of lifetime growth.</strong></p>
