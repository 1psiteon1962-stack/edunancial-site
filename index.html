  <main>
    <p>When my son was 11 years old, he walked in just as I hung up with a business client. My phone lit up showing a deposit. His eyes grew wide: “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” He said he wanted to learn—but didn’t know how. That’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born.</p>
    <p>At 15 he buys physical silver and gold, analyzes stocks, and earns 8–12% ROI. Anyone can learn financial literacy and improve their life. That’s our mission.</p>
