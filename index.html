      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>One afternoon when my son was 11, he walked in just as an online deposit arrived. His eyes got wide: “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” Then I asked him, “Do you want to work with your head?” “Yes,” he answered, “but I don’t know how.” That’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born.</p>
      <p>At 15, he analyzes, buys, and sells stocks with ranges of <strong>8–12% ROI</strong>; understands that there are many areas in real estate to pick from, and is putting a business together.</p>
      <p>Simple lessons in <strong>Red</strong> (Real Estate), <strong>White</strong> (Paper Assets), and <strong>Blue</strong> (Business). These are the <strong>Foundations of lifetime growth.</strong></p>
