  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> ____________________</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This KPI App Privacy Addendum (“Addendum”) supplements our main Privacy
    Policy and explains how Edunancial, Inc. (“Edunancial,” “we,” “us,” or
    “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use the
    Edunancial KPI tools, dashboards, and related scoring features
    (collectively, the “KPI App”).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect Through the KPI App</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on how you use the KPI App, we may collect the following
    types of information:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Account and profile data (name, email, login identifier);</li>
    <li>Business profile data (business name, industry, approximate revenue range, number of employees, time in business);</li>
    <li>Self-reported metrics (goals, sales ranges, debt ranges, budgeting habits, investment habits);</li>
    <li>App usage data (pages viewed, scoring actions, completion dates).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use KPI App Data</h2>
  <p>We use KPI App data to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate personalized KPI scores, dashboards, and recommendations;</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>4. Profiling and Automated Scoring</h2>
  <p>
    The KPI App assigns scores based on formulas and rules developed by
    Edunancial. These scores are intended to highlight strengths, risks,
    and opportunities in your financial habits or business systems. KPI
    App scores:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not make legal or financial decisions on your behalf;</li>
    <li>Are educational tools only, not credit scores or credit decisions;</li>
    <li>Should not be relied upon as the sole basis for any major decision.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We retain KPI App data for as long as reasonably necessary to provide
    the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or
    improve our tools. You may request deletion of your data as described
    in our main Privacy Policy and User Data Rights page.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your KPI App data. We may share data with trusted
    service providers who assist us with hosting, analytics, or email
    communication, subject to strict confidentiality and data protection
    agreements.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
