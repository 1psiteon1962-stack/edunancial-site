  <h1>Membership Terms &amp; Billing Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> ____________________</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These Membership Terms &amp; Billing Policy (“Membership Terms”) apply to all
    memberships, subscriptions, and recurring access plans (“Memberships”)
    offered by Edunancial, Inc. (“Edunancial,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) through
    Edunancial.com and related platforms (the “Site”).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Educational Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    Memberships provide access to educational content only. Memberships do
    not provide legal, tax, financial, or investment advice. You are solely
    responsible for consulting qualified professionals regarding your
    specific situation.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
  <p>
    To purchase and maintain a Membership, you may be required to create an
    account and provide accurate contact and payment information. You are
    responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login
    credentials and for all activity under your account.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Billing and Payment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Membership fees are charged on a recurring basis (monthly or annually, as specified at checkout).</li>
    <li>By starting a Membership, you authorize us and our payment processor to charge your selected payment method on a recurring schedule until you cancel.</li>
    <li>All fees are stated and charged in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Auto-Renewal</h2>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise stated, your Membership will automatically renew at the
    end of each billing period at the then-current rate. You may cancel
    future renewals at any time in your account settings or by contacting
    us before the next billing date.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Cancellations</h2>
  <p>
    You may cancel your Membership at any time. Unless otherwise expressly
    stated in a specific offer:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellations take effect at the end of the current billing period;</li>
    <li>No partial or pro-rated refunds are provided for unused time;</li>
    <li>After cancellation, you will lose access to Members-only content and tools at the end of the billing period.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Any refund rights will be stated in the specific Membership offer or on
    our Refund Policy page. Where no separate refund policy is provided,
    all Membership fees are non-refundable except where required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Membership Levels and Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may offer multiple Membership levels with different features, limits,
    or bonuses. We may modify, upgrade, downgrade or discontinue Membership
    levels at any time. If we materially reduce core benefits in a way that
    significantly affects you, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you
    in advance.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Use of Membership Content</h2>
  <p>
    Membership content (courses, videos, worksheets, KPI tools, guides, and
    other materials) is provided for personal, non-transferable use or for
    internal business planning. You may not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Share your login or Member content publicly;</li>
    <li>Resell, redistribute, or republish Member materials;</li>
    <li>Use Member content to create a competing product or service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. KPI Tools Within Memberships</h2>
  <p>
    If your Membership includes access to Edunancial’s KPI application or
    related tools, your use is also governed by the KPI intellectual
    property and privacy clauses contained in our Terms of Use and KPI App
    Privacy Addendum. Any attempt to reverse-engineer or replicate the KPI
    logic is strictly prohibited.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate your Membership and account immediately if
    we believe you have violated these Membership Terms, the Site Terms of
    Use, or any applicable law. In such cases, no refunds will be issued
    except where required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Relationship to Other Policies</h2>
  <p>
    These Membership Terms supplement, and do not replace, our Terms of
    Use, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, KPI App Privacy Addendum, and any
    other applicable policies. In the event of conflict, the more specific
    provision that better protects Edunancial’s intellectual property and
    legal rights will control.
