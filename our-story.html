  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <section class="card">
    <p>My son was eleven. I had just finished a business call when my phone lit up—an online deposit.
      His eyes went wide. “How did you make money like that?” he asked.
      “I used my head,” I said. “Would you like to do the same?”
      “Yes,” he said, “but I don’t know how.”</p>
    <p>That moment is when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born. We made a simple promise:
      teach practical money skills in colors anyone can remember—<em>Red</em> for Real Estate,
      <em>White</em> for Paper Assets, and <em>Blue</em> for Business. Short lessons. Clear steps. Real results.</p>
    <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #e6eef7;margin:16px 0">
    <p>By fifteen, my son had his first ounces of physical silver and gold. He read charts, compared costs,
      and asked smart questions at the coin shop. He also began picking and analyzing stocks—watching earnings,
      trends, and risk. With patience and discipline he learned to <strong>aim for an 8–12% return</strong> over time—
      never a guarantee, always a goal, and always with respect for risk.</p>
    <p>That’s the heart of Edunancial: hope with a plan. Anyone can learn financial literacy—one concept,
      one habit, one choice at a time—and use it to improve their circumstances.</p>
