  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    One afternoon when my son was 11, he walked in just as an online deposit arrived. His eyes went wide: 
    “How did you make money like that?” I said, “By using my head.” Then I asked, 
    “Do you want to work with your head?” He said, “Yes, but I don’t know how.” 
    That’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born.

    Today he analyzes, buys, and sells stocks, understands the foundations of real estate, 
    and is building a small business. Our lessons cover 
    <strong>Real Estate</strong> (Red), <strong>Paper Assets</strong> (White), and 
    <strong>Business</strong> (Blue) — the foundations of lifetime growth.
