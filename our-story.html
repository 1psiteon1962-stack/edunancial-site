    <section class="card">
      <p class="lead">
        One afternoon when my son was <strong>11</strong>, I had just ended a call with a business client
        when my phone lit up with an online deposit. He looked at me with wide eyes and asked,
        “How did you make money like that?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “By using my head,” I told him. He paused, thought about it, and said,
        <em>“I want to use my head too—but I don’t know how.”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That sentence changed everything. Right there, at our kitchen table, <strong>Edunancial</strong> began.
        We made a decision: he would learn how money works—clearly, slowly, and practically—so he could
        use his head with confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning to Use His Head</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> budgeting with purpose, paying himself first, and building an emergency cushion.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-world practice:</strong> small, consistent actions—comparing prices, reading receipts, setting savings targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Thinking time:</strong> asking better questions: <em>What’s the plan? What are the risks? What’s Plan B?</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We kept it simple and hands-on. No jargon. One page at a time.
      </p>

      <h2>From 11 to 15</h2>
      <p>
        By <strong>15</strong>, he had developed steady habits and a curious mind. He started buying small amounts of
        <strong>physical silver and gold</strong>, learned to read a company’s story beyond the ticker, and practiced how to
        <strong>select, buy, and sell stocks</strong> with patience—aiming for a consistent, realistic
        <strong>8–12% ROI</strong> over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn’t about luck. It was about using his head: thinking clearly, managing risk, and respecting the long game.
