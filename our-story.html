  <div class="card">
    <p>One afternoon when my son was 11, he walked in just as I finished a call with a business client. My phone lit up—an online deposit had arrived. His eyes got wide: “How did you make money like that?”</p>
    <p>“By using my head,” I said. He wanted to learn—but didn’t know how. That moment planted the seed. By 15, he was buying physical silver and gold, analyzing companies, and practicing how to select and sell stocks—aiming for a steady 8–12% ROI.</p>
    <p>That journey became <strong>Edunancial</strong>: practical financial literacy for anyone who wants to build a better future.</p>
