    <h3>How Edunancial began</h3>
    <p><strong>My son was eleven.</strong> I had just hung up from a business call when my phone lit up—an online deposit. His eyes went wide. “How did you make money like that?” he asked. “I used my head,” I said. “Would you like to do the same?” “Yes,” he replied, “but I don’t know how.”</p>
    <p>That moment is when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born. We made a simple promise: teach practical money skills in colors anyone can remember—<strong>Red</strong> for Real Estate, <strong>White</strong> for Paper Assets, and <strong>Blue</strong> for Business. Short lessons. Clear steps. Real results—so a kid with curiosity and a parent with purpose can see what’s possible, together.</p>
    <h3>From 11 to 15 — results</h3>
    <p>At fifteen, my son was buying physical silver and gold, picking and analyzing stocks, and aiming for an <strong>8–12% ROI</strong>. Not luck—literacy. Not theory—practice. The kind anyone can learn.</p>
    <p><em>That’s the heart of Edunancial:</em> hope you can apply, skills you can use, and the belief that better choices lead to better circumstances.</p>
