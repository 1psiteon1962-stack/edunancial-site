    <h3>How Edunancial began</h3>
    <p><strong>My son was eleven.</strong> I had just hung up a business call when my phone lit up—an online deposit. His eyes went wide. “How did you make money like that?” he asked. “I used my head,” I said. “Would you like to do the same?” “Yes,” he replied, “but I don’t know how.”</p>
    <p>That’s when <strong>Edunancial</strong> was born—teaching money with colors anyone can remember: <strong>Red</strong> for Real Estate, <strong>White</strong> for Paper Assets, <strong>Blue</strong> for Business. Short lessons. Clear steps. Real results.</p>
    <h3>From 11 to 15 — results</h3>
    <p>At fifteen, my son was buying physical silver and gold, analyzing stocks, and aiming for an <strong>8–12% ROI</strong>. Not luck—literacy. Not theory—practice. The kind anyone can learn.</p>
    <p><em>That’s the heart of Edunancial:</em> hope with a plan. Anyone can learn financial literacy and use it to improve their circumstances.</p>
