      Edunancial began with a simple question from my 11-year-old: 
      “How did you make money like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked in just as a client payment hit my phone. I told him the truth: 
      by learning how money works and <em>using my head</em>. He asked me to teach him.
      We started with basics—budgeting, saving—and quickly moved into buying
      small amounts of silver and gold, reading company reports, and tracking
      stocks together.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 15 he could explain P/E ratios and place practice trades. Our goal was
      never to “get rich quick” but to steadily aim for 8–12% ROI with common sense,
      patience, and risk management.
    </p>
    <p>
      That journey became <strong>Edunancial</strong>: a practical path for families who
      want financial literacy they can actually use.
