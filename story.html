<p>When my son was 11 years old, he came into my room as I was finishing a client call. He saw the payment come through on my phone and asked: “How did you do that?” I told him that in the military I worked with my back, but now I work with my head. I asked him: “Do you want to work with your back or your head?” He thought, then said: “With my head — but I don’t know how. Show me.”</p>
<p>That moment was the spark. Today, at 15, he has already bought and sold stocks, managed gold and silver, and is preparing for options trading. The skills he learned will last a lifetime. That’s how Edunancial was born — to help anyone build financial literacy and a better future.</p>
